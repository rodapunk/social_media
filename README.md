# About the project
This project aimed to develop the backend for web services using the Spring Boot framework with Java, integrating with the MongoDB database. The implementation followed a domain model and a logical layer structure, including resources (REST controllers) representing the application interface with the backend, as well as services and repositories. For testing, a database was configured and populated using MongoDB and MongoDB Compass, providing Java testing scenarios. The development covered the implementation of CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete) and exception handling.

The application execution utilized the Apache Tomcat web container, and Maven managed dependencies. Request tests were conducted through Postman, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the system's functionality. MongoDB Compass served as a visual tool to facilitate the administration and visualization of the MongoDB database.
